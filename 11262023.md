* Followed Replit's 100 Days of Code: Day 2.
* Found [Pep-8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) but I haven't read it all yet.
* Read [RealPython about PEP-8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#when-to-ignore-pep-8) which goes into setting up linter, autoformatting, and debugger.
* Read [RealPython about How to Read Python Input as Integers](https://realpython.com/python-input-integer/)
* Watched [Python Variables and Data Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFrQXaoSMQ]
* Watched [User Input in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMCOB8KElwo)
* Also found [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
* Watched [Naming Conventions in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW9j_3FpSzc) by Run That.
    #### I learned:
    * camelCase for Classes: camelCaseCapitalClass
    * snake_case for Variables, Modules, Packages (almost everything else): snake_case_looks_like_a_snake_with_underscoressss
    * ALLCAPS for Constants: PI = 3.14
    * Don't use keywords or reserved words in class names, variable names, etc.
    * Be descriptive and readable.
    * Don't use O, I or l because it looks like 0 and 1
    * Don't use x,y,z except for short or simple things â€” i, j, k are common for itirating, n is common for number, etc.
    * Variables must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
    * Variables canâ€™t start with a digit (0â€“9).
    * Variables are case sensitive.
    * Document or comment the meanings of important classes, variables, etc.
    * Be consistent with whatever styling used
 
  # What I Learned

  ### ðŸŸ£ Here is the code from Replit Day 2: Variables and Input
  ```python
  name = input("What's your name? ")
  #print("Hello, " + name + "!!!")
  age = input("What is your age? ")
  #print("You are " + age + " years old.")
  # ^ Here, age is a string
  fav_food = input("What is your favorite food? ")
  fav_music = input("What is your favorite music? ")
  location = input("Where do you live? ")

  print("You are " 
      + name 
      + " and you are " 
      + age 
      + " years old. You like to eat " 
      + fav_food 
      + " and you like to listen to " 
      + fav_music 
      + " and you live in " 
      + location 
      + ". Stay positive!" )
  ```
