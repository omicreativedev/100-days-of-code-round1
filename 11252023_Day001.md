* Followed [Replit's 100 Days of Code: Day 1](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/).
* Watched [Chuck](https://youtu.be/mRMmlo_Uqcs) explain the same thing.
* Rabbithole üê∞ reading [RealPython about print()](https://realpython.com/python-print/).
* Started playlist [Install Python 3.8 and Django 3.0 + on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzQ33Q5xhD5naEV9K-Z6upZw) from [CodingEntreprenuers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGor6fssp6c&list=PLEsfXFp6DpzQjDBvhNy5YbaBx9j-ZsUe6)
* Note: I'm on Windows 11 üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. However, I hear the pros use Linux ü§ñ (or wsl) but I'll figure that out later.
* This is a handy little IDE for trying code without signing up for anything. https://www.online-python.com/

# What I Learned
### üü£ Commenting & Documentation
This is a single line comment
```python
# Python uses the pound sign for comments.
print("You cannot see a comment in the console") #Comments can go on new line or after code on same the line.
# But when they start a line, the whole line is commented out. print("This is invisible")
```
Multiple line comments use ''' three apostrophes.
```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment
using 3 apostrophes.
'''
```
Docstrings are for helping to explain functions and other parts of the code and are used mostly by automated documentation generators.
Note: Don't worry about this right now.
```python
"""
This is a docstring that provides documentation

:param: A description of the parameter.
:return: A description of the return value.
"""
```
Moving on...
### üü£ Print() and Introduction to Strings
* Print is a built in function, meaning it's part of 

Print something to the console.
```python
print("Hello World")
# Output: Hello World
```
Single quotes are okay too but not when there is an apostrophe in the string.
```python
print('Hello World')
# Output: Hello World
```
For instance, this doesn't work.
```python
print('That's Enough.') #Notice that the single quote and apostrophe is confusing.
# Output: üö´üí©
```
But, this works. \ is used to _escape_ the apostrophe. I like to think of it as _escaping_ catastophe.
```python
print('That\'s Enough.')
# Output: That's Enough
```
A new line can be created with \n which means new line.
```python
print("Hello\n World")
# Output:
# Hello
# World
```
Or \t for tab.
```python
print("Hello\t World")
# Output: Hello    World
```
Or \\ for a backslash... because it's escaping itself (aren't we all.)
```python
print("Hello\\ World")
# Output: Hello\ World
```
Intsead of making multiple new lines with \n, python lets you triple quote for multiple lines.
```python
print("""Everything
after the triple quote
is printed.""")
# Output:
# Everything
# is printed
# one statement at a time.
```
Which is the same as doing this:
```python
print("Everything")
print("is in printed")
print("one statement at a time.")
# Output:
# Everything
# is printed
# one statement at a time.
```
Strings can be rendered one after another. print() can take multiple arguments.
```python
print("My name is", "John.")
print("I am ", 25, " years old.") # Here, 25 is an integer not a string.
# Output: My name is John. I am 25 years old.
```
Strings can also be _concatinated_ which means linked or strung together.
```python
print("Strings " + "strung together " + "on the same line.")
# Output: Strings strung together on the same line.
print("My name is John. " + "I am " + "25 years old.") # Here, 25 is a string.
# Output: My name is John. I am 25 years old.
```
Strings can be printed _raw_ and unformatted too.
```python
print(r"This is a raw string.\n No new line rendered.") # r is for raw, rawr. ü¶ñ
# Output: This is a raw string.\n No new line rendered.
```
The _separator parameter_ will put something between values.
```python
print("one", "two", "three", sep="-")
# Output: one-two-three
print("one", "two", "three", sep="---") # It's not limited to one charachter
# Output: one---two---three
```
The _end parameter_ will put something after all values
```python
print("one", "two", "three", end="!")
#Output: one two three!
print("one", "two", "three", end="!!!!!") # It's not limited to one character
# Output: one two three!!!!!
```
You can print in Unicode, including symbols.
```python
print("\u03A9")
# Output: Œ©
```
Unicode can be used to print emoji too.
```python
smiley_face = "\U0001F604"
print("Hello, World! " + smiley_face)
# Output: Hello, World! üòÄ
```
Using an _f-string_, you can place a variable (even of a different data type) right inside a string.
```python
age = 21
print(f"You are {age} years old")
```
