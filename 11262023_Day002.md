# Day 002 of 100
* Followed [Replit's 100 Days of Code: Day 2](https://replit.com/@omicreative/day2100-days).
* Found [Pep-8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) but I haven't read it all yet.
* Also found [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
* Read [RealPython about PEP-8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#when-to-ignore-pep-8) which goes into setting up linter, autoformatting, and debugger.
* Read [RealPython about How to Read Python Input as Integers](https://realpython.com/python-input-integer/).
* Watched [Python Variables and Data Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFrQXaoSMQ) by BroCode
* Watched [User Input in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMCOB8KElwo) by BroCode
* Lessons 1, 2, and 3 from [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) at py4e.com
* [Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXr0-J5XXMA) episode 2- variables.
* Watched [Naming Conventions in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW9j_3FpSzc) by Run That.
    #### I learned:
    * camelCase for Classes: camelCaseCapitalClass
    * snake_case for Variables, Modules, Packages (almost everything else): snake_case_looks_like_a_snake_with_underscoressss
    * ALLCAPS for Constants: PI = 3.14
    * Don't use keywords or reserved words in class names, variable names, etc.
    * Be descriptive and readable.
    * Don't use O, I or l because it looks like 0 and 1
    * Don't use x,y,z except for short or simple things â€” i, j, k are common for itirating, n is common for number, etc.
    * Variables must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
    * Variables canâ€™t start with a digit (0â€“9).
    * Variables are case sensitive.
    * Document or comment the meanings of important classes, variables, etc.
    * Be consistent with whatever styling used
 
# What I Learned

### ðŸŸ£ Here is the code from Replit Day 2: Variables and Input
  ```python
  name = input("What's your name? ")
  #print("Hello, " + name + "!!!")
  age = input("What is your age? ")
  #print("You are " + age + " years old.")
  # ^ Here, age is a string
  fav_food = input("What is your favorite food? ")
  fav_music = input("What is your favorite music? ")
  location = input("Where do you live? ")

  print("You are " 
      + name 
      + " and you are " 
      + age 
      + " years old. You like to eat " 
      + fav_food 
      + " and you like to listen to " 
      + fav_music 
      + " and you live in " 
      + location 
      + ". Stay positive!" )
  ```
### ðŸŸ£ Variables
A variable is a reusable container for storing a value. It's like a bucket.
```python
bucket = "Water"
print("The bucket is full of", bucket, ".")
# Output: The bucket is full of Water.
```
The most recent thing put in the variable is the value of the variable.
```python
bucket = "Water"
bucket = "Milk"
print("The bucket is full of", bucket, ".")
# Output: The bucket is full of Milk.
```
The value of the variable can change data types.
```python
bucket = "Water" # This is a string
bucket = 123456789 # This is an integer
print("The bucket is full of", bucket, ".")
# Output: The bucket is full of 123456789.
```
### ðŸŸ£ Data Types and type()
* Wrapping a variable in the type() function will tell you what kind of data type it is.
Int means Integer (a whole number)
```python
my_int_var = 100
print(my_int_var)
print(type(my_int_var))
print(type(100))
# Output:
# 100
# <class 'int'>
# <class 'int'>
```
Float means Double (a number with decimals)
```python
my_float_var = 2.1
print(my_float_var)
print(type(my_float_var))
print(type(2.1))
# Output:
# 2.1
# <class 'float'>
# <class 'float'>
```
Complex means mixed numbers.
```python
my_complex_var = 1 + 4j
print(my_complex_var)
print(type(my_complex_var))
print(type(1 + 4j))
# Output:
# (1+4j)
# <class 'complex'>
# <class 'complex'>
```
String means text, or a string of characters. There are no chars, only strings of 1 character length.
```python
my_string_var = "Hello" # Must be in single or double quotes
print(my_string_var)
print(type(my_string_var))
print(type("Hello"))
# Output:
# Hello
# <class 'str'>
# <class 'str'>
```
Booleans are True or False, which are good for things like yes/no, on/off, etc.
```python
my_bool_var = True
print(my_bool_var)
print(type(my_bool_var))
print(type(True))
# Output:
# True
# <class 'bool'>
# <class 'bool'>
```
List is similar to an array or vector. - More on this later...
```python
my_list_var = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list_var)
print(type(my_list_var))
print(type([1, 2, 3]))
# Output
# [1, 2, 3]
# <class 'list'>
# <class 'list'>
```
Individual items from lists can be isolated and printed seperately too.
```python
# Forwards...
print(my_list_var[0]) # Value 1 is index 0
print(my_list_var[1])
print(my_list_var[2])
# Or Backwards...
print(my_list_var[-1]) # Value -1 is 1st from the back in reverse
print(my_list_var[-2])
print(my_list_var[-3])
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 3
# 2
# 1
```
Dictionary - More on this later...
```python
my_dict_var = 'name':'Omi'
print(my_dict_var)
print(type(my_dict_var))
print(type({'name':'Omi'}))
# Output:
# {'name': 'Omi'}
# <class 'dict'>
# <class 'dict'>
```
Set - More on this later...
```python
my_set_var = {1.1, 3.14, 2.5}
print(my_set_var)
print(type(my_set_var))
print(type({1.1, 3.14, 2.5}))
# Output:
# {1.1, 2.5, 3.14}
# <class 'set'>
# <class 'set'>
```
Tuple - More on this later...
```python
my_tuple_var = (1.1, 3.14, 2.5)
print(my_tuple_var)
print(type(my_tuple_var))
print(type((1.1, 3.14, 2.5)))
# Output:
# (1.1, 3.14, 2.5)
# <class 'tuple'>
# <class 'tuple'>
```
